#Johnson's Groceries Client
# Overview
This is a simple grocery store client that allows the user/employee to interact with a database that stores the stock information for a store's inventory. This software allows the user/employee to view an item's current stock and product info, medit that stock or info, add new items to stock, and even form a full receipt and finalize a purchase. This software is written completely in python, and utilizes google firebase for all data storage and managementt. I wrote this program to learn more about how to use cloud databases in programming.

# Cloud Database
The cloud database that I used is from google, called firebase. It is a simple NoSQL, non-relational database.
The database includes only the information for each item in the store's inventory, each item having the attributes of "stock", "price", and "info". 
# Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE, along with firebase for my database needs.
I used python, along with the firebase API libraries in order to write this program.

# Future Work
* I would include sales tax on the receipt portion of the program. 
* I would add item information for not just some items, but all items that are currently in the store inventory on the database.
* I would spruce up the main menu and any other menu's themselves to make them more visually appealing and better spaced out.
