#Johnson's Groceries Client
# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database.  Describe how to use your program.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
This is a simple grocery store client that allows the user/employee to interact with a database that stores the stock information for a store's inventory. This software allows the user/employee to view an item's current stock and product info, medit that stock or info, add new items to stock, and even form a full receipt and finalize a purchase. This software is written completely in python, and utilizes google firebase for all data storage and managementt. I wrote this program to learn more about how to use cloud databases in programming.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database
The cloud database that I used is from google, called firebase. It is a simple NoSQL, non-relational database.
The database includes only the information for each item in the store's inventory, each item having the attributes of "stock", "price", and "info". 
# Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE, along with firebase for my database needs.
I used python, along with the firebase API libraries in order to write this program.

# Future Work
* I would include sales tax on the receipt portion of the program. 
* I would add item information for not just some items, but all items that are currently in the store inventory on the database.
* I would spruce up the main menu and any other menu's themselves to make them more visually appealing and better spaced out.
